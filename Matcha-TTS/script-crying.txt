I don’t know how to stop the tears.
It just hurts too much.
Why does it always feel like this?
I didn’t expect it to hurt this badly.
I thought I could handle it, but I can’t.
Why does everything feel so heavy?
I just want this pain to end.
It’s all too much to bear right now.
I don’t know what to do anymore.
I can’t keep pretending I’m okay.
I feel like I’m drowning in my own thoughts.
I just want someone to hold me.
I don’t think I can take another moment of this.
I never wanted to feel this way.
Why does it have to be this hard?
I just want things to go back to normal.
It feels like everything’s falling apart.
My heart feels like it’s breaking.
I don’t know if I can keep going like this.
I wish things were different.
Everything hurts more than I ever imagined.
I feel so lost right now.
I can’t make sense of any of this.
It’s like I’m stuck in this pain.
I don’t want to feel this way anymore.
The weight is too much to carry.
Why does it feel like no one understands?
I can’t find the strength to get through this.
Why is this happening to me?
It feels like there’s no way out of this sadness.
I just need someone to tell me it’s going to be okay.
I don’t think I can stop these tears.
I don’t even know who I am anymore.
Why does everything feel so overwhelming?
I never thought it would be like this.
I feel like I’ve lost everything.
It’s all slipping through my fingers.
I don’t want to be this weak.
I can’t stop thinking about everything that’s gone wrong.
I just want to feel peace.
I don’t know how to fix this.
I want to run away from all the pain.
I keep waiting for this to end, but it doesn’t.
I feel so empty inside.
Why does everything feel so out of my control?
I wish I could just cry and let it all go.
I’m trying so hard, but it doesn’t feel like enough.
I just want to stop feeling so broken.
The silence is too loud in my head.
I can’t escape these feelings.
Why do I always feel so alone?
I don’t know how to stop feeling like this.
It’s like my heart is shattered.
I just need some comfort, anything.
I wish I could understand why this hurts so much.
I feel like I’m falling apart.
There’s no easy way out of this pain.
I just want to be okay again.
I don’t even know where to start healing.
Everything just feels so wrong right now.
