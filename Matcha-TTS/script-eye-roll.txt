Are we really doing this right now?
Oh, of course. Because that makes total sense.
Seriously? You’ve got to be kidding me.
This is a joke, right?
I don’t even know how to respond to that.
Yeah, like that’s going to work.
I can’t believe I’m hearing this.
I just don’t have the energy for this.
You’ve got to be joking.
This is honestly ridiculous.
Is this really happening?
Well, that’s one way to do it, I guess.
I can’t with you right now.
You’re honestly still talking about this?
Like, who even thinks like that?
That was the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.
I’m done. Just done.
I don’t even know what to say anymore.
Wow, just wow.
I can’t even pretend to care anymore.
This is what we’re doing? Seriously?
Unbelievable.
I’m really not going to waste my time on this.
What a surprise, not.
Yeah, keep talking — it’s not getting any smarter.
Is this supposed to be impressive?
I think I’m losing brain cells just listening to this.
Are you actually serious right now?
Yeah, okay. Sure, whatever.
This is so typical.
Can we just move on, please?
I’m just over it at this point.
How do you even come up with this stuff?
I’m rolling my eyes so hard right now.
I’ve had enough of this nonsense.
Could this be any more obvious?
I’m not even going to dignify that with a response.
Yeah, that’ll work — just like everything else you’ve tried.
I don’t know how you keep doing this to yourself.
Honestly, it’s like you’re trying to make me cringe.
I’m not even mad, just disappointed.
I can’t believe I’m still listening to this.
You’ve got to be messing with me.
Is this for real?
Do you hear yourself?
Are you sure you want to go down that road?
I don’t even have the energy for this anymore.
You’re doing the most, and for what?
Honestly, I don’t know what to say.
This is the kind of thing you look back on and cringe.
I guess we’re just going to pretend this makes sense.
That was... something, I guess.
I don’t even care enough to argue.
Is this supposed to impress me?
I’m just going to walk away now.
You should really think before you speak.
Oh, this is going to be fun, not.
I’m already done with this conversation.
I’m just trying to keep it together.
Alright, I’m going to go ahead and not engage.
