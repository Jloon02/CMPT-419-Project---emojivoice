This is the worst thing I’ve ever witnessed.
I don’t think I can handle much more of this.

I’m scared to even think about what could happen next.
This is too much for me to handle.
I can’t believe this is actually happening right now!
I’m in complete shock and horror.
I’m so scared, I don’t know what to do.
